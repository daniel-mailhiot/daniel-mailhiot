## Hi there 👋 I'm Daniel


- 🔭 I'm currently studying software development through UBC's Extended Learning Program with a focus on the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.

- 😎 What I bring to the team:
  - Experience with collaborative Git-driven workflows for game audio implementation, and a track record of working autonomously to meet deadlines as a Service & Operations Coordinator.
  - I pair collaborative, Git-driven workflows with a service mindset on every project, building responsive web applications to help teams deliver reliably and meet tight deadlines with clear, well-documented and maintainable code.

- 🌱 Looking to collaborate with teams and on projects where I can contribute and grow.
